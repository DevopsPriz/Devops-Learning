FILE MANIPULATION USING LINUX

1.  SUDO COMMAND 

In Unix-like operating systems, the command sudo , which stands for "superuser do," is used to grant a permitted user the ability to execute commands as the super user. As a result, it's employed for tasks requiring root or administrative access.

The syntax: sudo (command for example; apt ugrade)

It becomes: sudo apt-get upgrade

The installed packages on your system can be upgraded to the their latest versions using this command.
